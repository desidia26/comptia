## Viruses

- Malicious code that runs on a machine without the user's knowledge and
  infects the computer when executed.
- Viruses require user action
- Types of Viruses
  1. Boot Sector
    - Stored int he first sector of a hard drive and are loaded into memory upon boot up
    - Nice because typical antivirus won't find them, as they are not stored in the traditional
      area considered a file system
    - Usually spread by hardware
  2. Macro
    - Virus embedded into a document and is executed when the document is opened by the user.
  3. Program
    - Targets executable and parasites onto those to run alongside
  4. Multipartite
    - Virus that combines boot and program viruses to the boot sector and system files
      before attacking other files on the computer.
    - Able to place self in boot, and spread to rest of computer. What a bitch.
  6. Polymorphic
    - Encrypted virus that changes its encryption up every now and then to evade detection
  7. Metamorphic
    - Changes *itself* completely, functionality and all.
  8. Stealth
    - Any virus that avoids detection through the above means
  9. Armored
    - Have a layer of protection to confuse a program or person analyzing it.
  10. Hoax
    - Not really a virus
    - Trick user into infecting their own machine.
